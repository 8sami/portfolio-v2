        After messing around and learning different stuff, I have acquired hands‑on experience with both Python and JavaScript, particularly, NextJS,
        ReactJS, Typescript, Django, Django Ninja, Flask and many more things that I won’t be able to fit here. I have a good understanding and experience
        of version control and deployments and, not to forget, I have created many N8N automation flows and used AI for different use cases, worked with
        Supabase, Strapi CMS, different UI libraries(Shadcn, Chakra, AntDesign etc.), also tried app development with Expo and didn’t like it
