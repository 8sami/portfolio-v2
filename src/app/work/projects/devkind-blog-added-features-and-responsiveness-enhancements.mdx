## Overview

Improved Devkind's main website by adding new strapi and frontend components and fixing a number of issues. The work focused on both the ui and the functionality of the site. I worked with **Next.js** and **Strapi**.

## Key Features

- **New Content Blocks**: Added dynamic FAQs, development process blocks and more. These can be added and edited from the Strapi CMS and dynamically rendered on the frontend.
- **Chat Migration**: Migrated from Crisp Chat to Freshworks Chat.
- **Improved Blog Page**: Added a collapsible table of contents, call to action and list of related blogs on each blog page.
- **Bug Fixes**: Solved various issues across the site.
  - Fixed markdown tables and other text formatting issues.
  - Fixed issues with meta data fetching.
  - Fixed bugs with the Calendly and Slack integrations.
  - Fixed layout and responsiveness issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Chakra UI, GraphQL
- **Backend**: Strapi CMS
- **Tools**: Docker for local setup, Gitlab

## Challenges and Learnings

- Was hard setting up new components in both the Strapi and Next.js for the first time.
- Finding and fixing complex bugs like the meta data issue was tedious.
- Learning how to use Docker for local development and having to fix detached volumes was a pain.
- Making sure the website looked and worked right on all devices required too much back and forth.

## Outcome

- The website has become more flexible and with fewer bugs.
- Authors can create richer pages with new content blocks.
- Fewer bugs ensure better user experience.
- Blogs are now more fun to read.
