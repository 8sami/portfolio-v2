## Overview

I built GradAccelerate's mobile app from scratch. This project also included improvements to their existing website built with Next.js and Strapi. The mobile app uses **Expo and Supabase**. It focuses on daily user engagement and supporting course curriculum and many other features.

## Mobile App Features

- **Daily Quizzes**: A core feature for users to answer daily questions to help them learn and stay active.
- **Push Notifications**: Sends a daily alert to remind users when a new quiz is ready.
- **User Authentication**: Lets users sign up or log in using google or email to save their streaks, achievements and daily scores.

## Website Improvements

- **Application Wizard**: Simplified the application process to a three-step guide with a progress bar.
- **Form Validation**: Added real-time checks to the form using Zod to prevent errors.
- **CRM Integration**: Connected the form to Freshworks CRM to receive applicant's responses.
- **Automation Pipeline**: Set up an n8n workflow to help with shortlisting candidates resumes/CVs.
- **Responsive Design**: The website works well on all devices.

## Technologies Used

### Mobile App

- **Framework**: Expo
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)

### Website

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Form Handling**: Zod
- **CRM**: Freshworks API
- **Automation**: n8n, google drive, resume parser npm package and gemini api

## Challenges and Learnings

1.  **Mobile App Development**
    - Worked with mobile app development for the first time and hated it to be very honest.

2.  **Responsive Layouts**
    - Making sure that the apply form looked good on all screen size was tedious.

## Outcome

- The mobile app promotes daily engagement.
- The website's application process is now easier to use.
- The applicant shorlisting process is automated.
- The form has zero submission errors.
