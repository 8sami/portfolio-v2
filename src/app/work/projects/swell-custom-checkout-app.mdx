## Overview

I worked on a new checkout application for the Swell platform. My goal was to make a tool that is plug and play for different stores. I did about 60% of the total work and also helped lead the project by deciding the order of tasks and guiding some of the development.

***

## Key Features

- **Flexible Checkout Steps**: Took an existing three-step checkout and removed specific complex client logic and converted it to work dynamically as a 3-step or 1-step checkout. 
- **State and Style**: Handled all the **Zustand** states and **Tailwind CSS**. The code is built with **Next.js**. 
- **Custom Theme Support**: Added theme support using **Cloudflare KV stores** and headers. This means we do not need multiple deployments for different looks. 
- **UI Customization**: Used **Easy Blocks UI** to set up the design tools. This works with a checkout customizer to change the UI easily (i also built the checkout customizer). 
- **Redirection Logic**: Updated the logic of how the site validates and redirects users based on the checkout configuration.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Tools**: Easy Blocks UI, Cloudflare KV
- **Platform**: Swell

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Leading the Team**: Even with one year of experience, I got the opportunity to lead some parts of the project by guiding the team on what to do and in which order. 
2. **Testing and Setup**: Managed and deployed a separate Swell store for testing. Worked closely with the testing team and gave them all the info to find bugs. 
3. **App Architecture**: Guided how to build the Swell app to support the customizer. This included managing environment variables to toggle checkout behaviors.

## Outcome

The 1-step checkout has a 35% increase in completion rate and massively reduced the time to checkout. Most of the complex logic is removed and many silent bugs are fixed. Although I resigned before the product was fully finished but I helped build the core parts.

Building a complex checkout requires clear logic and a lot of testing.

The checkout had multiple versions, ie, 1st version was theme integration, 2nd version was conversion of the 3 step checkout to 1 step (dynamically and conditionally), 3rd version was merging both versions and adding new features. 4th version was implementing checkout customiser... etc. Each version has separate deployments.
