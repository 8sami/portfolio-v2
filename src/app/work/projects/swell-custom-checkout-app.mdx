## Overview

I did about 60% of the work on this customizable checkout app for Swell. I wasn't really a "lead" in the senior sense—I've only got about a year or so of experience—but I ended up doing most of the heavy lifting and basically showed everyone else what needed to happen. I handled a huge chunk of the development, kept things moving in the right order, and even had to guide the testing guys on exactly what they should be looking for. I even set up a separate Swell store just for testing because the main environment was a mess to work with.

It was a lot of coding and a bit of "herding cats."

## Key Features

- **Stripping Client Logic**: We started with this 3-step checkout from an old client project. It was full of weird, specific logic and random edge cases. I spent a lot of time just scraping all that out and converting it into a flexible system that could do either 1-step or 3-step checkouts. 
- **The Frontend Core**: I handled all the Zustand states, the Next.js setup, and the Tailwind CSS. Basically the whole UI and state logic.
- **Middleware & Bug Squashing**: Found a ton of bugs and fixed them. The redirection logic in the middleware was pretty broken, so I had to rewrite it to actually work properly.
- **Theming via Cloudflare**: Instead of doing a bunch of separate deployments, I used Cloudflare KV stores and headers for custom theme support. It meant we could change things without needing a whole new build.
- **Visual Customizer**: Used Easy Blocks UI for the customization side. I extended the theme support so it would actually play nice with the checkout customizer tool.
- **The Swell App Part**: I didn't actually write the Swell app myself, but I told the team how to build it so it would support the customizer, the step toggles, and all the environment variables that control how the checkout behaves.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Edge/Backend**: Cloudflare KV, Next.js Middleware
- **Tools**: Swell, Easy Blocks UI

## Challenges and Learnings

Taking someone else's messy, client-specific code and trying to make it "plug and play" for everyone is a massive headache. You find so many weird dependencies. It was also my first time really having to tell other people what to do and managing a testing flow, which was a learning curve on top of just writing the code.

## Outcome

I ended up resigning before the finished product actually went live, but I built about 60% of the core foundation. It's a solid, flexible system that handles the customizer and different checkout flows really well.
