## Overview

I built this Chrome extension for my own needs and CS50x final project. Its a to-do list tool which is simple, lightweight and fast. All other options were too bulky and slow. I wanted something that was fast and did not distract me. So I created Taskly. It is fast, simple and helps with focus.

## Key Features

- **Basic Task Management**: Users can add, check off and delete tasks quickly.
- **Saves Your Work**: Tasks and settings are saved in local storage. Users will not lose them if they close their browser.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Users can choose between a dark or light theme.
- **Instant Updates**: The screen updates right away. There is no waiting or reloading.
- **Small Window**: The tool opens in a small window and does not get in the way.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Chrome Local Storage API

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a Chrome extension was new for me. I had to learn how manifest files and the storage API work by reading online guides and stack overflow threads. I also learned how to debug and fix errors using extension inspect tools.

## Outcome

Taskly is now my daily tool for quick notes. It works just right for me. I learned a lot about how browser tools are made. I now understand CRUD and local storage API much better.
