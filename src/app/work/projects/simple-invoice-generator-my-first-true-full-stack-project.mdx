## Overview

This was my first full-stack project. My goal was to build a tool that a real business could use. It needed to create invoices. I had to learn many new things. I learned to build APIs, use Next.js, and work with Django. I found solutions by searching online and reading documentations.

***

## Key Features

- **Full-Stack Design**: The front and back ends work on their own. They talk to each other using APIs.
- **Invoice Tools**: You can create and view invoices. The tool keeps track of all the details.
- **Client and Invoice Tracking**: You can add clients and track invoices.
- **PDF Creation**: It makes invoices into professional PDFs. These are ready to print.
- **User Login**: The system has a secure login. This keeps user data safe.
- **Modern Design**: The site looks good on all devices. I used Shadcn UI and TypeScript.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Django Ninja
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn UI
- **PDFs**: ReactPDF for making PDFs
- **Database**: MySQL

## Challenges and Learnings

This was my first time doing most of these things. I wrote my first API. I connected the front end to the back end. It took hours to fix problems. I had to solve issues with data and user login. I learned by reading docs and trying things out. This made me a better developer.

## Outcome

The Simple-Invoice-Generator is a working tool. It helps a business get paid faster. Now, these types of projects do not seem so hard.

This project shows you can build real software. You just have to keep trying. Don't be afraid to make mistakes (I plan to convert it into a SaaS product IA).
