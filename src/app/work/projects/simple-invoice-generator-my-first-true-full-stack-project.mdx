## Overview

This was my first full-stack project. My goal was to build a tool that a real business could use. It needed to create invoices and quotations. I had to learn many new things: learned to build APIs using Django Ninja, learned Next.js and Django. I found solutions to problems by surfing stack overflow and reading a lot of documentation.

## Key Features

- **Full-Stack**: The front and back ends are connected using APIs.
- **Invoice Tools**: You can create and view invoices and quotations. The tool keeps track of all the details.
- **Client and Invoice Tracking**: You can add clients and track invoices.
- **PDF Creation**: Print invoices and quotations as PDFs.
- **User Login**: The system has a secure login to keep user data safe.
- **Modern Design**: The site looks good on all devices, used Shadcn UI and tailwind.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Django Ninja
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn UI
- **PDFs**: ReactPDF for making PDFs
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Deployment**: PythonAnywhere, Vercel

## Challenges and Learnings

This was my first time doing most of these things. I wrote my first API, connected the front end to the back end. It took hours to fix problems. I had to solve issues with cors, data and user login. I learned most of these things by reading docs and trying things out. This made me a better developer and made me fall in love with product development.

## Outcome

The Simple-Invoice-Generator is a working tool. It helps a business get paid faster. Now, these types of projects do not seem so hard anymore.

This project shows you can build real software. You just have to keep trying. Don't be afraid to make mistakes (I plan to convert it into a SaaS product soon).
