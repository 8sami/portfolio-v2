## Overview

During the bolt.new hackathon, I helped build OSSIdeas. This platform finds startup ideas from open source github repositories. I handled the development of the payment system, user authentication and various frontend features.

***

## Key Features

**My Work:**
- **Stripe Payments**: I set up the payment system to manage subscriptions and different price levels while handling payment events.

- **Supabase Login**: Built the user authentication system which lets users sign up and log in with email and password or Google oauth.

- **Website Design**: I made sure the site worked on phones and computers responsively. I used Tailwind CSS for the design.

***

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Login/Payments**: Supabase Auth, Stripe
- **Build**: Vite, Netlify

***

## Outcome

- The platform has a secure and reliable payment system.
- User data is secure.
- The site is easy to navigate and use.
- The design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
