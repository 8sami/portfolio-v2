## Overview

I rebuilt and redesigned the whole Razalution website from scratch using modern tools to make it better and improve load times. The goal was to improve its look, functionality and increase conversions.

## Key Features

- **New User Interface**: Gave the site a fresh, modern look, used **v0.dev** to help with the redesign.
- **Contact Form**: Built a contact form which sends emails using **SendGrid** and also saves responses to **Google Sheets**.
- **Modern Framework**: Built with **Next.js** and implemented the contact saving logic using n8n via a webhook.
- **Improved Design**: Used **Tailwind CSS** for the new UI which is cleaner, responsive and more modern.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Tool**: v0.dev
- **Email Service**: SendGrid
- **Database**: Google Sheets
- **Automation**: n8n

## Challenges and Learnings

1.  **Client Requirements**: It was hard to find a middle ground with the client. Their ideas were sometimes not good for design or code. I had to explain the problems clearly. I had to be patient and help them understand.

2.  **Prompt Writing**: I learned how to write good prompts for AI. This helped me get better designs from v0.dev. I made a database of prompts that works really well for redesigning and generating websites by following brand theme and tone.

## Outcome

- The new website is live and looks better.
- It has a working contact form.
- The client was happy with the final result.
- I learned how to manage expectations of clients on projects.
